## Description
*Chess Predictor* is a deep learning model that predicts the outcome of chess games based on the move sequences. The model is trained on over 1 million chess games scraped from lichess.com.

## Report
For a more detailed breakdown of this project, see the [report](https://github.com/ajnipp/Chess-Predictor/blob/main/COMP_562_Final_Project_Report.pdf) in this repo.

## Data
We used the a chess dataset on Kaggle linked [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arevel/chess-games).

The tensors used in the last script (model.ipynb) can be found at this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PAw4_FNSvBneohZ6c3nlEncy47kYq2fn/view?usp=sharing). This contains the x and y tensors for games with the last 5 moves stripped, as well as the weights for the best model.
